[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://article-summarizer-app.streamlit.app) üëàüèª Give it a try!


### Generate summaries of news articles or blog posts using Google's language model Pegasus via ü§ó HuggingFace's API. 

Pegasus is an encoder-decoder style transformer, specifically trained for abstractive summarization tasks. For this app I used the checkpoint: [google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail](https://huggingface.co/google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail), trained on the CNN-Dailymail corpus.

*For more information about the model, see the original paper [PEGASUS: Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08777.pdf) by Jingqing Zhang, Yao Zhao, Mohammad Saleh and Peter J. Liu, published on Dec 18, 2019.*

**Considerations:**
- The model works best with articles in English
- Articles behind paywall restrictions can't be accessed
- Longer articles require more processing time and resources
- It may not be possible to scrape some websites
